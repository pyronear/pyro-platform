## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 (or more recent)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installation

You can clone and install the project dependencies as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-platform.git
pip install -r pyro-platform/requirements.txt
```



## Usage

Beforehand, you will need to set a few environment variables either manually or by writing an `.env` file in the root directory of this project, like in the example below:

```
API_URL=http://my-api.myhost.com
API_LOGIN=my_secret_login
API_PWD=my_very_secret_password

```
Those values will allow your web server to connect to our [API](https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-api), which is mandatory for your local server to be fully operational.

#### Plain dash server

You can run the web server using the following commands:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

Then your Dash app will be available at http://localhost:8050/

#### Dockerized dash server

If you wish to deploy this project on a server hosted remotely, you might want to be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. You can perform the same using this command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Like previously, you can navigate then to http://localhost:8050/ to interact with your Dash app.
