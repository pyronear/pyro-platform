The following file is dedicated to the "Risk Score" view of the dashboard.

Following a first section dedicated to imports, the content section is made of 3 blocks:

- the departments and risk score acquisition block, used to fetch the scores of each department;
- the choropleth map attributes block, which constructs the dl.GeoJSON object, as well as the color scale;
- a final block mobilising previously defined functions to instantiate the "Risk Score" map.

Most functions defined below are called in the main.py file, in the risks callbacks.
