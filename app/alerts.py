The following Python file is dedicated to the "Alerts and Infrastructure" view of the dashboard.

After a first block dedicated to imports, the content section is divided between:

- a departments block used to read the local geojson file and create the corresponding object on the map;
- a sites markers block used to instantiate markers corresponding to detection units on the field;
- a fire alerts block used to create alert-related objects and the interactive zoom;
- a final block mobilising previously defined functions to instantiate the "Alertes et Infrastructure" map.

Most functions defined below are called in the main.py file, in the alerts callbacks.
