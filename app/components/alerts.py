def create_event_list():

    Creates a container for the alert list with a fixed height and scrollable content.

    This function generates a Dash HTML Div element containing a header and an empty container.
    The empty container ('alert-list-container') is meant to be populated with alert buttons
    dynamically via a callback. The container has a fixed height and is scrollable, allowing
    users to browse through a potentially long list of alerts.

    Returns:
    - dash.html.Div: A Div element containing the header and the empty container for alert buttons.
