"""The following is dedicated to the "Alertes et Infrastructures" dashboard.

The main item is the AlertsApp function that returns the corresponding page layout.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Imports

### Pandas, to read the csv file with positions of  cameras on the field
import pandas as pd

### Useful import to read the GeoJSON file
import json

### Various modules provided by Dash to build the page layout
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
import dash_leaflet as dl
import dash_leaflet.express as dlx

### From navbar.py to add the navigation bar at the top of the page
from navbar import Navbar

### Various imports from utils.py, useful for both Alerts and Risks dashboards
from utils import map_style, build_info_object


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Before moving to app layout

## This function takes as input the number of clicks on the button defined above and returns the layer style to use
