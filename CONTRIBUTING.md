# Contributing to pyro-plateform

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth and productive workflow.

Whatever the way you wish to contribute to the project, please respect the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

To get started with the project, please refer to the dedicated section in the [README.md](README.md) for detailed instructions.


## Feature requests & bug report

Whether you encountered a problem, or you have a feature suggestion, your input has value and can be used by contributors to reference it in their developments. For this purpose, we advise you to use Github [issues](https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-platform/issues).

First, check whether the topic wasn't already covered in an open / closed issue. If not, feel free to open a new one! When doing so, use issue templates whenever possible and provide enough information for other contributors to jump in.


## Developing your feature

### Configure your fork

1 - Fork this [repository](https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-platform) by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right of the page. This will create a copy of the project under your GitHub account (cf. [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)).

2 - [Clone your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local disk and set the upstream to this repo
```shell
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT>/pyro-platform.git
cd pyro-api
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-platform.git
```

### Commits

- **Code**: ensure to provide docstrings to your Python code. In doing so, please follow [Google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) so it can ease the process of documentation later.
- **Commit message**: please follow [Udacity guide](http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)


### Code quality

To run all quality checks together

```shell
make quality
```

The previous command won't modify anything in your codebase. Some fixes (import ordering and code formatting) can be done automatically using the following command:

```shell
make style
```

### Submit your modifications

Push your last modifications to your remote branch
```shell
git push -u origin a-short-description
```

Then [open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your fork's branch. Follow the instructions of the Pull Request template and then click on "Create a pull request".
